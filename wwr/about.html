            <h2> History</h2>
            <p> In the heart of Mexico's rugged wilderness, our story begins with a relentless passion for adventure and an unwavering love for the pristine rivers that carve through our land. It all started when our founders, a group of adventurous souls with roots in Mexico but a spark of curiosity ignited in Canada, discovered the exhilarating world of white-water rafting. Their journey took them to the icy rivers of Canada, where they were captivated by the thrill and camaraderie of this extreme sport.

                With their newfound inspiration and determination, they returned to their homeland, Mexico. Here, they embarked on a mission to introduce this adrenaline-pumping adventure to the warm and vibrant landscapes of Mexico. They believed in the transformative power of nature and the unifying spirit of rafting. It was more than just a business; it was a revolution.
                
                Over the years, our company has grown, but our commitment to preserving the natural beauty of Mexico and sharing the excitement of rafting remains unchanged. Today, we continue to weave stories of courage, laughter, and unforgettable moments on the rapids. We invite you to be part of our journey, to experience the rush of the river, and to join us in preserving the magic of Mexico's wild waters. This is not just a business; it's a legacy of passion, discovery, and the unyielding belief that adventure can change lives. Come, let's make history together on the rivers of Mexico.</p>
