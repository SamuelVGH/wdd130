        <p> Mexico City is one of the most important cultural and financial centers in the world. According to Aztec legend, the city of Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City, was founded around 1325 when the Aztecs, guided by their god Huitzilopochtli, saw an eagle perched on a cactus, eating a snake, signaling the chosen site. They built their capital on an island in Lake Texcoco and developed a thriving civilization. However, in 1521, Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés captured Tenochtitlan, and the Spanish subsequently established Mexico City on its ruins, becoming the capital of New Spain. This legend combines Aztec mythology with historical events, marking the city's rich and complex history.</p>
